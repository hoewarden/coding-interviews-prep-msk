# Preparing for coding interviews together, in English

![a binary tree logo](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/Complete_binary.svg/200px-Complete_binary.svg.png)

Essentially this is an English speaking club, but with solving coding problems. Our meetings have no structure so far, we just use Leetcode, Hackerrank, and the "Cracking the Coding Interview" book. That simple. We'll get more organized a bit later.

We are a friendly community, but If you'd like we could simulate a real-world whiteboard interview, including:

- Judgemental stares at you for minor typos and missing semicolons
- Condescending remarks about your answers
- Asking you impossibly hard questions and pretending we didn't have to decipher available solutions for two days beforehand

Joking, don't be stressed too much. Just say hello, introduce yourself, and start geeking out.

We meet at the Kocherga anticafe in Moscow (https://kocherga-club.ru/), which means each of us pays for the time spent there: 2.5 rubles per minute, it's 150 rubles per hour. They have free coffee and cookies though, and a wonderful nerdy atmosphere, you'll love it I promise. And they have VR btw.

# Your homework

1. Sign up to https://www.hackerrank.com/, https://www.leetcode.com/, and https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ to be ready to solve coding problems on these sites
2. Actually solve a couple of entry level problems to get comfortable with the interface
3. Install a dictionary on your phone and don't hesitate to use it

## Target language

You can also focus on practicing in your target language first. For example:

- https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/python
- https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/cpp
- https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/tutorials/10-days-of-javascript

# To-do list

TODO: a list of good online courses

TODO: a list of algorithms theory and data structures topics, so we can rotate them every arbitrary period of time, e.g., a month or two: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/top-10-algorithms-in-interview-questions/

TODO: add more data science interview questions

TODO: code of conduct

# Plans for upcoming meetings

- How [Timsort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timsort) works
- The modern dictionaries talk by Raymond Hettinger, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p33CVV29OG8, about the dict implementation in python 3.7

# Log of our activity

## 2019-09-22

We discussed how decision trees, random forests, feature importance work. And solved some problems from past meetings.

## 2019-09-15

Discussed streams in java 8, decision trees for regression, and other random topics.

[CTCI](#CTCI) 16.23:

> Rand7 from Rand5: Implement a method rand7() given rand5(). That is, given a method that generates a random number between 0 and 4 (inclusive), write a method that generates a random number between 0 and 6 (inclusive).

Tried to decipher this problem for analytics position:

> Calculate subscription to refund conversion rate with a 1 day conversion window applied. Group by subscription date and apply 7 days rolling average.

https://leetcode.com/problems/word-ladder/

## 2019-09-08

We decided to start with an easy problem we had last time, namely [is-subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/is-subsequence/), and Kate confused it with the [is-substring](https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-strstr/) and implemented the [Knuth–Morris–Pratt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth–Morris–Pratt_algorithm) algorithm right away.

Meanwhile we had a discussion about a product analytics job interview. And unrelated topics.

https://leetcode.com/problems/shuffle-an-array/  

Homework: https://leetcode.com/problems/word-ladder/

## 2019-09-01

We can't have enough of the [trapping-rain-water](https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/) problem. We discussed both quadratic and linear time solutions after introducing it to newcomers.

https://leetcode.com/problems/surface-area-of-3d-shapes/  
https://leetcode.com/problems/is-subsequence/  

We briefly discussed normal forms. And tried to start a conversation about the REST architecture at the very end, but it's a huge topic, and everyone has different perspectives.

## 2019-08-25

https://leetcode.com/problems/subarray-sum-equals-k/

Talked about a friend of a friend who had enough discipline to get thoroughly prepared for the google interview process and now works at the headquoters in Switzerland.

## 2019-08-18

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/maximum-difference-between-two-elements/

A discussion of the Big O notation. And a small group of people showed off their knowledge of haskell and monads to each other.

## 2019-08-11

Turns out the [trapping-rain-water](https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/) problem is not as easy as it seems. Most of us managed to write a bad non-linear solution, but there's a good one: [solutions/trapping-rain-water.clj](solutions/trapping-rain-water.clj).

A group of people discussed the following big question: how does pagination work? How to implement it with and without sql? Why offset+limit is slow and what to use instead? Spoiler: keyset pagination.

## 2019-08-04

https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/  
https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number/, https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number-ii/  
https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/  

## 2019-07-28

We spent most of the time introducing ourselves and talking. Then a group of people started helping a newbie with python, and others opened the season with solving the following:

https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-words-in-a-string/ — the in-place variant  
https://leetcode.com/problems/next-permutation/
