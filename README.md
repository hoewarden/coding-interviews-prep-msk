# Preparing for coding interviews together, in English

![a binary tree logo](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/Complete_binary.svg/200px-Complete_binary.svg.png)

Essentially this is an English speaking club, but with solving coding problems. Our meetings have no structure so far, we just use Leetcode, Hackerrank, and the "Cracking the Coding Interview" book. That simple. We'll get more organized a bit later.

We are a friendly community, but If you'd like we could simulate a real-world whiteboard interview, including:

- Judgemental stares at you for minor typos and missing semicolons
- Condescending remarks about your answers
- Asking you impossibly hard questions and pretending we didn't have to decipher available solutions for two days beforehand

Joking, don't be stressed too much. Just say hello, introduce yourself, and start geeking out.

We meet at the Kocherga anticafe in Moscow (https://kocherga-club.ru/), which means each of us pays for the time spent there: 2.5 rubles per minute, it's 150 rubles per hour. They have free coffee and cookies though, and a wonderful nerdy atmosphere, you'll love it I promise. And they have VR btw.

# Your homework

1. Sign up to https://www.hackerrank.com/ and https://www.leetcode.com/ to be ready to solve coding problems on these sites.
2. Actually solve a couple of problems to get comfortable with the interface.
3. Install a dictionary on your phone.

You can also focus on practicing in your target language first. For example, https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/python or https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/cpp.

# To-do list

TODO: a list of algorithms theory and data structures topics, so we can rotate them every arbitrary period of time, e.g., a month or two

TODO: buy a hardcopy of the "Cracking the Coding Interview" book

TODO: a list of phone interview questions, https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2015/02/50-programmer-phone-interview-questions-answers.html

## 2019-08-11

Turns out the [trapping-rain-water](https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/) problem is not as easy as it seems. Most of us managed to write a bad non-linear solution, but there's a good one: [solutions/trapping-rain-water.clj](solutions/trapping-rain-water.clj).

A group of people discussed the following big question: how does pagination work? How to implement it with and without sql? Why offset+limit is slow and what to use instead? Spoiler: keyset pagination.

## 2019-07-28

We spent most of the time introducing ourselves and talking. Then a group of people started helping a newbie with python, and others opened the season with solving the following:

- https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-words-in-a-string/ â€” the in-place variant
- https://leetcode.com/problems/next-permutation/
