# Preparing for coding interviews together, in English

Essentially this is an English speaking club, but with solving coding problems. Our meetings have no structure so far, we just use Leetcode, Hackerrank, and the "Cracking the Coding Interview" book. That simple. We'll get more organized a bit later.

We are a friendly community, but If you'd like we could simulate a real-world whiteboard interview, including:

- Judgemental stares at you for minor typos and missing semicolons
- Condescending remarks about your answers
- Asking you impossibly hard questions and pretending we didn't have to decipher available solutions for two days beforehand

Joking, don't be stressed too much. Just say hello, introduce yourself, and start geeking out.

We meet at the Kocherga anticafe in Moscow (https://kocherga-club.ru/), which means each of us pays for the time spent there: 2.5 rubles per minute, it's 150 rubles per hour. They have free coffee and cookies though, and a wonderful nerdy atmosphere, you'll love it I promise. And they have VR btw.
