# Old meetup.com announcement

Hello, fellow coders. As always we meet on Sunday at 17:00. If you're new here, the rules are simple and easy:

- Be nice to each other
- Geek out like nobody's watching

Your homework:
1. Sign up to https://www.hackerrank.com/, https://www.leetcode.com/, and https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ to be ready to solve coding problems on these sites
2. Actually solve a couple of entry level problems to get comfortable with the interface
3. Install a dictionary on your phone and don't hesitate to use it

You can also focus on practicing in your target language first. For example:
- https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/python
- https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/cpp
- https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/tutorials/10-days-of-javascript

There will be two big parts, happening at the same time:

- Solving problems from leetcode et al. and writing algorithms down by hand
- Live coding session on a big screen, with streaming it on twitch

You can write code on your laptop by yourself as well, just don't forget to interact with humans.

--------------------------------------------------
Code of conduct:
We are building a friendly nerdy community, an environment to help each other both with solving coding problems and with overcoming struggles to communicate in English while being judged for your answers. We're whiteboarding, not waterboarding. It should feel like a videogame: it's ok to fail and try again. Encourage and be patient.
--------------------------------------------------

==================================================
Our telegram chat: https://t.me/coding_interviews_prep_msk — feel free to ask coding questions and discuss upcoming meetings.

Our repo: https://github.com/koddo/coding-interviews-prep-msk

Stream: https://www.twitch.tv/koddo/ — we're looking for a star that wouldn't be too shy to perform live coding.
==================================================

A reminder: we meet at the Kocherga anticafe (https://kocherga-club.ru), which means each of us pays 2.5 rubles per minute, it's 150 rubles per hour. They have free coffee and cookies though, and a lovely atmosphere.

See you.
